# NAME

RAND\_bytes, RAND\_pseudo\_bytes - generate random data

# SYNOPSIS

    #include <openssl/rand.h>

    int RAND_bytes(unsigned char *buf, int num);

Deprecated:

    #if OPENSSL_API_COMPAT < 0x10100000L
    int RAND_pseudo_bytes(unsigned char *buf, int num);
    #endif

# DESCRIPTION

RAND\_bytes() puts **num** cryptographically strong pseudo-random bytes
into **buf**. An error occurs if the PRNG has not been seeded with
enough randomness to ensure an unpredictable byte sequence.

RAND\_pseudo\_bytes() has been deprecated. Users should use RAND\_bytes() instead.
RAND\_pseudo\_bytes() puts **num** pseudo-random bytes into **buf**.
Pseudo-random byte sequences generated by RAND\_pseudo\_bytes() will be
unique if they are of sufficient length, but are not necessarily
unpredictable. They can be used for non-cryptographic purposes and for
certain purposes in cryptographic protocols, but usually not for key
generation etc.

The contents of **buf** is mixed into the entropy pool before retrieving
the new pseudo-random bytes unless disabled at compile time (see FAQ).

# RETURN VALUES

RAND\_bytes() returns 1 on success, 0 otherwise. The error code can be
obtained by [ERR\_get\_error(3)](http://man.he.net/man3/ERR_get_error). RAND\_pseudo\_bytes() returns 1 if the
bytes generated are cryptographically strong, 0 otherwise. Both
functions return -1 if they are not supported by the current RAND
method.
