# NAME

x509 - X.509 certificate handling

# SYNOPSIS

    #include <openssl/x509.h>

# DESCRIPTION

A X.509 certificate is a structured grouping of information about
an individual, a device, or anything one can imagine.  A X.509 CRL
(certificate revocation list) is a tool to help determine if a
certificate is still valid.  The exact definition of those can be
found in the X.509 document from ITU-T, or in RFC3280 from PKIX.
In OpenSSL, the type X509 is used to express such a certificate, and
the type X509\_CRL is used to express a CRL.

A related structure is a certificate request, defined in PKCS#10 from
RSA Security, Inc, also reflected in RFC2896.  In OpenSSL, the type
X509\_REQ is used to express such a certificate request.

To handle some complex parts of a certificate, there are the types
X509\_NAME (to express a certificate name), X509\_ATTRIBUTE (to express
a certificate attributes), X509\_EXTENSION (to express a certificate
extension) and a few more.

Finally, there's the supertype X509\_INFO, which can contain a CRL, a
certificate and a corresponding private key.

**X509\_**_..._, **d2i\_X509\_**_..._ and **i2d\_X509\_**_..._ handle X.509
certificates, with some exceptions, shown below.

**X509\_CRL\_**_..._, **d2i\_X509\_CRL\_**_..._ and **i2d\_X509\_CRL\_**_..._
handle X.509 CRLs.

**X509\_REQ\_**_..._, **d2i\_X509\_REQ\_**_..._ and **i2d\_X509\_REQ\_**_..._
handle PKCS#10 certificate requests.

**X509\_NAME\_**_..._ handle certificate names.

**X509\_ATTRIBUTE\_**_..._ handle certificate attributes.

**X509\_EXTENSION\_**_..._ handle certificate extensions.
